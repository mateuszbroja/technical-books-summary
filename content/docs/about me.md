# About me

Hi there! My name is `Mateusz` and I'm a book enthusiast and content writer who enjoys summarizing and sharing insights from books I've read. I created a website where I share book summaries and reviews to help others get the most important takeaways without having to read the entire book.

If you'd like to get in touch with me regarding copyright or any other inquiries, please feel free to contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-b-631308152/).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mateuszbroja).

And for more information about me and my work, please visit my personal website: [matbroya.com](https://matbroya.com/).

Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you find my book summaries helpful!
