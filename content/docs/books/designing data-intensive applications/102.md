# Data Models and Query Languages
---

Most applications are built by layering one data model on top of another.

Graph
application developer -> objects or data structures, and APIs -> general-purpose data model, such as JSON or XML documents -> bytes in memory, on disk, or
on a network -> electrical currents, pulses of light, magnetic fields


## Relational Model Versus Document Model

The best-known data model today is probably that of SQL, based on the relational
model proposed by Edgar Codd in 1970

by the mid-1980s
relational database management systems (RDBMSes) and SQL had become the tools
of choice
The dominance of relational databases has lasted around 25‒30 years

The roots of relational databases lie in business data processing

use cases:
transaction processing (entering sales or banking transactions,
airline reservations, stock-keeping in warehouses) and batch processing (customer
invoicing, payroll, reporting)


competing approaches
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the network model and the hierarchical model
Each competitor to
the relational model generated a lot of hype in its time, but it never lasted

the web today is still powered by
relational databases


## The Birth of NoSQL

NoSQL is the latest attempt to overthrow the relational model’s
dominance

“NoSQL” is unfortunate, since it doesn’t actually refer to any
particular technology—it was originally intended simply as a catchy Twitter hashtag
for a meetup on open source, distributed, nonrelational databases in 2009

Not Only SQL


several driving forces
need for greater scalability
widespread preference for free and open source software over commercial
database products
Specialized query operations
Frustration with the restrictiveness of relational schemas



The Object-Relational Mismatch
Most application development today is done in object-oriented programming languages,
which leads to a common criticism of the SQL data model: if data is stored in
relational tables, an awkward translation layer is required between the objects in the application code and the database model of tables, rows, and columns. The disconnect
between the models is sometimes called an impedance mismatch.i
